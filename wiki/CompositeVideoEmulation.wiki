=Composite NTSC/PAL video emulation=

OpenEmulator features an NTSC/PAL video emulation that runs on GPU's. Emulations and monitors are completely separated by using actual composite video signals. There are also many settings that allow for many kinds of monitors:

 * IRE black/white levels
 * PAL/NTSC chroma demodulator, with variable chroma carrier frequency
 * Dynamic 19-tap luma/chroma filters
 * Y'UV/Y'IQ decoding with brightness, contrast, saturation and hue controls
 * CRT barrel effect
 * Dynamic scanlines
 * Center lighting effect (for simulating old CRT's who emit more light in the center of the screen)
 * PAL phase alternating lines

What's in the work:

 * PAL/NTSC dot crawl
 * Realistic shadow mask/aperture grill simulation
 * Phosphor persistance
 * PAL chroma mixing
