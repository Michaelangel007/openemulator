=Composite NTSC/PAL video emulation=

OpenEmulator features a NTSC/PAL video emulation that runs on GPU's. Most monitors can be emulated as this emulation uses emulated composite video signals. Some of the settings are:

 * IRE black/white levels
 * PAL/NTSC chroma demodulator, with variable chroma carrier frequency
 * Dynamic 19-tap luma/chroma filters
 * Y'UV/Y'IQ decoding with brightness, contrast, saturation and hue controls
 * CRT barrel effect
 * Dynamic scanlines
 * Center lighting effect (for simulating old CRT's who emit more light in the center of the screen)
 * PAL phase alternating lines

What's in the work:

 * PAL/NTSC dot crawl
 * Realistic shadow mask/aperture grill simulation
 * Phosphor persistance
 * PAL chroma mixing
