=Composite NTSC/PAL video emulation=

OpenEmulator features an NTSC/PAL video emulation that runs on a GPU. Emulations and monitors are completely separated by using actual composite video signals. Many kinds of monitors can be emulated by combining the following features:

 * IRE black/white levels
 * NTSC chroma demodulator, with variable chroma carrier frequency and line phase advance
 * Dynamic 17-tap luma/chroma filters
 * Y'UV decoder with brightness, contrast, saturation and hue controls
 * Y'IQ decoder with standard I and Q bandwidth
 * PAL phase alternating lines
 * NTSC/PAL dot crawl
 * CRT barrel effect
 * Dynamic scanlines
 * Realistic triad/slit mask/aperture grill simulation
 * Center lighting effect (for simulating old CRT's emitting more light in the center of the screen)
 * Phosphor persistance

Here you can see the canvas controls of a generic monitor:

And the decoded image (notice the cross luma/chroma artifacts resulting from old chroma decoding techniques):
